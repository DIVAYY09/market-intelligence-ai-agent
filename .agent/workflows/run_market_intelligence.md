1. Run the scraper to update social signals:
   ```powershell
   python scraper.py
   ```

2. Ensure the development server is active. Start it if it's not running:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open or refresh the browser to view the dashboard at local server (e.g., http://localhost:5173).
