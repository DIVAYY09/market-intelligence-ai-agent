    "brief": "This headline from Bloomberg posits that advanced AI coding agents could render significant portions of the SaaS sector obsolete, signaling a potential disruption to the Software-as-a-Service model. This is a bold prediction about AI's impact on software development and delivery.\n\nProduct managers should take this threat very seriously. The development of sophisticated AI coding agents necessitates a re-evaluation of existing SaaS business models and product roadmaps. Innovation should focus on areas where human oversight, creativity, or specialized integration remain paramount, or explore how AI can be integrated to enhance SaaS offerings rather than be replaced by them.",
